Lifecycle hooks are a special functionality in Angular that allow us
 to “hook into” and run code at a specific lifecycle event of a 
 component or directive. Angular manages components and directives 
 for us when it creates them, updates them, or destroys them.

OnChanges	Called when the input properties have changed
OnInit	Called on initialization
DoCheck	Developer’s custom change detection
OnDestroy	Called before the component is destroyed
AfterContentInit	Called when the component’s content ngContent is initialized
AfterContentChecked	Called when the component’s content is updated or checked for updates
AfterViewInit	Called when the component’s projected view has been initialized
AfterViewChecked	Called after the projected view has been checked
